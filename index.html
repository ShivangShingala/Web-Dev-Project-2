            How to play the game?
        </h2>

        <h3>
        This game is a journey into the world of mathematical anticipation, as you and your opponent match wits in combat â€” 
        a real brain-bender. This game is played with hands in real life, but what if you don't have anyone to play with it? Here is how advancement in  
        technology made is possible to play alone. I have created an online version of the same game you play with your hands.However, The only difference is
        you would be playing against the <b>ALMIGHTY computer</b>. <br>
        You have to select a gesture(Rock/Paper/Scissor) by entering a number. Computer would make it's own decision. It has only two possible outcomes a draw,
        or a win for one player and a loss for the other player. Remember: Rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock. 
        <strong>Have fun!</strong>
